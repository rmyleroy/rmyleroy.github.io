After obtaining my PhD in signal and image processing in 2024, where I developed deep learning methods for the design of monocular 3D vision systems, I continued my career as a postdoctoral fellow at INRIA. I am currently working on developing methods for image compression.

My interest in scientific research and innovation in the field of vision systems began during my engineering training at IMT Atlantique, where I graduated in 2019 with both a Master of Engineering and a Master of Science and Technology.

My expertise ranges from sensor level to image processing, with a particular interest in applied research and its innovation potential.
