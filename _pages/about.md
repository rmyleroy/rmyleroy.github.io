I am an engineer and scientific researcher specializing in image processing and computer vision, with a deep intuition for visual signal interpretation and a profile that bridges optics, physics, and deep learning. After completing my PhD in signal and image processing in 2023—where I developed deep learning methods for the design of monocular 3D vision systems—I worked as a postdoctoral fellow at INRIA until August 2024, focusing on methods for image compression.

My journey into vision systems began during my engineering studies at IMT Atlantique, where I earned both a Master of Engineering and a Master of Science and Technology in 2019. Since then, I’ve built expertise that spans from sensor level to image processing, always guided by a strong interest in applied research and its innovation potential.

I value clarity, simplicity, and reproducibility in algorithm design, and I strive to develop solutions that are not only robust but also maintainable and well-structured. Naturally inquisitive, I’m driven by a need to understand how things work—down to the core mechanisms.
